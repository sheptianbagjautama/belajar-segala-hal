<!-- Define Semantic Elements as Block Elements
HTML5 defines eight new semantic elements. All these are block-level elements.

To secure correct behavior in older browsers, you can set the CSS display property for these HTML elements to block: -->

<!-- 
header, section, footer, aside, nav, main, article, figure {
  display: block; 
}
 -->
